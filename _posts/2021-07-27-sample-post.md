## Partially, but it also obeys your commands.

I call it luck. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.

- Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
- What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.
- I'm trying not to, kid.

I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.

I call it luck. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?

### In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.
I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

1. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.
2. What?!
3. I call it luck.

You don't believe in the Force, do you? Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. What!? Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.

Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.
